# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Initial basic project setup for attorneyLotus032.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling excited about this project.  It is the first project of this kind for me.  The project is a basic template for a one page website for a firm of attorneys.

### Day 2: June 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. General Page Layout: Added structure and styling to overall page layout. Used CSS Grid for 
the page layout.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy enough with what I want to achieve with the general page layout.  It might change a bit as I add more structure and styling to the other sections of the page.

### Day 3: June 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Sidebar: Added content, structure and styling to testimonials section.

**Thoughts:** Everything went well and I am happy with how it turned out.  I hit a bit of a snag with the bottom margin of each testimonial but it is sorted now. However, there still remains a bit of a niggle with the bottom padding on screen sizes larger than say 2300px or there abouts.  Then paragraph lines reduce as the element size of increases up until a certain point where the bottom margin almost disappears.  It is to do with the img that floats left.  Not a biggy. Will sort it out later.

### Day 4: June 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. FAQ: Added content, structure and styling to FAQ section.

**Thoughts:** Not entirely happy with the styling of the FAQ section.  I'll probably work on improvements today.  Otherwise, I'm happy with the progress I'm making.  Doing this website is just phase 1 of my ultimate plan.

### Day 5: June 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Header: Added content, structure and styling to header section.

**Thoughts:** 

1. I've started with the header section yesterday. It is still a work in progress. Used the min( ) function in a clever way to increase the height of a centered div as the screen size decreases. This solves a problem across different mobile screen sizes. Will continue with improvements today.  I am extremely proud of how I used the min() function to solve a problem that bugged me in many previus projects.
   
2. I've finalised the header section and I'm stoked by how it looks. I changed the font color and sorted the spacing of elements inside the content-container.  The styling accross all screen sizes looks really pleasing. Will now move on the footer section. Hopefully that will go quick.

### Day 6: June 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Footer: Added content, structure and styling to footer section.

**Thoughts:** 

Today was a bit of a slow start. Not happy at all with the styling. And struggling to get an answer on how to undo the italics inside the address tag. Sigh....

### Day 7: June 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  Footer: Changed content, structure and styling of footer section.

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Remembered the clear-fix-solution when using floats. The <address> html tag --> font-style: normal (problem solved). Will spend the rest of this morning on the footer. Yes, it's worth it. ðŸ˜ƒ

2.  Changed the content, structure and styling of footer.  I feel much more confident about the content and styling of the footer.  The dark background and lightgrey font works better then the mudbrown background and dark font.  Have implemented the normal font-style on the address tag.  Haven't done anything about the clearfix solution.

### Day 8: June 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  Main: Added structure and content of main section.

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Loadshedding threw a spanner in the works, so I couldn't finalise the styling of the main section.  However, there is far more content and sections within the main section than in any other part of the project.  Feeling great about how the project is coming along. Almost 10 days!

### Day 9: June 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  Main: Add initial styling to main section.

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Although the initial styling sucks I know that it will all come together in the end!

### Day 10: June 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  Main: change markup and add photos to project

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Searched for more photos and did some styling on photos in figma. This takes up allot time. Reviewed CSS Grid to refresh. Had to contend with loadshedding and home projects.  So didn't do as much coding as I would have liked to.

### Day 11: July 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  JavaScript: Primitives and the console, numbers, Nan, variables and let, updating variables, const and var, booleans, variable naming and conventions.

2.  JavaScript: String basics, indices and length, undefined and null, string methods, string template literals, random numbers and the math object.
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  To keep a skill sharp you have to use and review it constantly.  The more I practice and review, the more things stick to memory.  I feel positive about my progress.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
