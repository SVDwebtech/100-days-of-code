# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Initial basic project setup for attorneyLotus032.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling excited about this project.  It is the first project of this kind for me.  The project is a basic template for a one page website for a firm of attorneys.

### Day 2: June 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. General Page Layout: Added structure and styling to overall page layout. Used CSS Grid for 
the page layout.
   

**Thoughts:** I'm happy enough with what I want to achieve with the general page layout.  It might change a bit as I add more structure and styling to the other sections of the page.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
