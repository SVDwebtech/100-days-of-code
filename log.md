# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Initial basic project setup for attorneyLotus032.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling excited about this project.  It is the first project of this kind for me.  The project is a basic template for a one page website for a firm of attorneys.

### Day 2: June 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. General Page Layout: Added structure and styling to overall page layout. Used CSS Grid for 
the page layout.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy enough with what I want to achieve with the general page layout.  It might change a bit as I add more structure and styling to the other sections of the page.

### Day 3: June 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Sidebar: Added content, structure and styling to testimonials section.

**Thoughts:** Everything went well and I am happy with how it turned out.  I hit a bit of a snag with the bottom margin of each testimonial but it is sorted now. However, there still remains a bit of a niggle with the bottom padding on screen sizes larger than say 2300px or there abouts.  Then paragraph lines reduce as the element size of increases up until a certain point where the bottom margin almost disappears.  It is to do with the img that floats left.  Not a biggy. Will sort it out later.

### Day 4: June 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. FAQ: Added content, structure and styling to FAQ section.

**Thoughts:** Not entirely happy with the styling of the FAQ section.  I'll probably work on improvements today.  Otherwise, I'm happy with the progress I'm making.  Doing this website is just phase 1 of my ultimate plan.

### Day 5: June 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Header: Added content, structure and styling to header section.

**Thoughts:** 

1. I've started with the header section yesterday. It is still a work in progress. Used the min( ) function in a clever way to increase the height of a centered div as the screen size decreases. This solves a problem across different mobile screen sizes. Will continue with improvements today.  I am extremely proud of how I used the min() function to solve a problem that bugged me in many previus projects.
   
2. I've finalised the header section and I'm stoked by how it looks. I changed the font color and sorted the spacing of elements inside the content-container.  The styling accross all screen sizes looks really pleasing. Will now move on the footer section. Hopefully that will go quick.

### Day 6: June 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Footer: Added content, structure and styling to footer section.

**Thoughts:** 

Today was a bit of a slow start. Not happy at all with the styling. And struggling to get an answer on how to undo the italics inside the address tag. Sigh....

### Day 7: June 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  Footer: Changed content, structure and styling of footer section.

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Remembered the clear-fix-solution when using floats. The <address> html tag --> font-style: normal (problem solved). Will spend the rest of this morning on the footer. Yes, it's worth it. ðŸ˜ƒ

2.  Changed the content, structure and styling of footer.  I feel much more confident about the content and styling of the footer.  The dark background and lightgrey font works better then the mudbrown background and dark font.  Have implemented the normal font-style on the address tag.  Haven't done anything about the clearfix solution.

### Day 8: June 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  Main: Added structure and content of main section.

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Loadshedding threw a spanner in the works, so I couldn't finalise the styling of the main section.  However, there is far more content and sections within the main section than in any other part of the project.  Feeling great about how the project is coming along. Almost 10 days!

### Day 9: June 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  Main: Add initial styling to main section.

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Although the initial styling sucks I know that it will all come together in the end!

**Link to work:** [Attorney Lotus Website](https://github.com/SVDwebtech/attorneyLotus032)

### Day 10: June 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  Main: change markup and add photos to project

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Searched for more photos and did some styling on photos in figma. This takes up allot time. Reviewed CSS Grid to refresh. Had to contend with loadshedding and home projects.  So didn't do as much coding as I would have liked to.

### Day 11: July 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  JavaScript: Primitives and the console, numbers, Nan, variables and let, updating variables, const and var, booleans, variable naming and conventions.

2.  JavaScript: String basics, indices and length, undefined and null, string methods, string template literals, random numbers and the math object.
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  To keep a skill sharp you have to use and review it constantly.  The more I practice and review, the more things stick to memory.  I feel positive about my progress.

### Day 12: July 02, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  JavaScript: Decision making, comparison operators, equality, console, alert and prompt methods, if, else-if and else statements, nesting conditionals, truth-y and false-y values, logical And, Or and Not operators, and switch statements.
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  JavaScript: Always loved logical operators combined with if, else-if and else statments. This combined with loops and functions opens up the magic of the coding world. If you really commit you might just find out how deep the rabbit hole goes....

### Day 13: July 04, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  JavaScript: Arrays, arrays in genereal, array random access, push & pop, shift & unshift, concat, indexOf, includes & reverse, slice & splice, reference types & equality testing, arrays & const, multi-dimensional arrays.
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  JavaScript: Just love arrays in JavaScript. Easy to understand and even easier to use. Also love that you can store different types in a JavaScript array.  Don't get me wrong, typesafety is important, but ....

### Day 14: July 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  JavaScript: Object literals, intro, create object literals, accessing data out of objects, modifying objects, nesting arrays and objects.
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  JavaScript: Objects in JavaScript are the object of my affection. With a better understanding of objects and arrays I now realize how powerfull objects and arrays are when used in conjunction.

### Day 15: July 06, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  JavaScript: Intro to loops, examples of for loops, infinite loops, looping over arrays, nested loops, while loops, break keyword, for-of loops and itering over objects.
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  JavaScript: Repeating stuff with loops. It's better than fruit loops. Built a nice console todo-app. Now we're getting somewhere.

### Day 16: July 07, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  CSS: CSS selectors, universal & element selectors, class and id selectors, descendant and direct-descendant selectors, adjacent and attribute selectors, psuedo classes and elements, CSS cascade, CSS specificity, inline styles & !important, CSS inheritance.
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  CSS: Although my knowledge of selectors has improved over time, I still forget some of the handiest selectors.  I enjoy reviewing css selectors as it is easy to see how to apply it practically and realise good use cases for challanges in the past.

### Day 17: July 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  HTML Email Signature: Create a customized HTML Email Signature
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  HTML Email Signature: This is all new for to me.  A bit frustrating as I am not sure how it will turn out.  I am sure it will turn out alright in the end. Doesn't appear to be that difficult though.

### Day 18: July 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  HTML Email Signature: Started a online tutorial for html email signatures

### Day 19: July 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1.  HTML Email Signature: Change structure content and styling of project
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Wow. This was up and down a bit.  But I think I nailed it. Still have to test it on many different email client's though.

1. Email Authentication;

2. HTML Form Submission: Html form element, sending data with JS to email.
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Email authentication is something I'm not familiar with and boy was it a frustrating day.  I still feel I do not have any clear answers and I'm nowhere near a solution. Yet. 
   
2. HTML Form Submission: Did some research on other alternatives as the smtpJS.com solution doesn't to work well in conjunction with email authentication. 

**Link to work:** [HTML Email Signature](https://github.com/SVDwebtech/goDaddyEmailSignature034)

### Day 22: July 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Email Authentication;

2. HTML Form Submission: Html form element, sending data with JS to email.
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Email authentication is new territory.  Feel a bit better after receiving a mail from elasticemail.com for some guidance. I smiled when I was able to sorth out authentication in respect of emails from my godaddy account to gmail.  On the HTML form submission horizon it appears that I will have to use a workaround for now.

### Day 23: July 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Email Authentication;

2. HTML Form Submission: Html form element, sending data with JS to email.
   

**Thoughts:** 

1.  Email authentication and HTML form submission conclusion: I think for now I am definitely taking the workaround option until I am able to solve this once I have reviewed AJAX and NODEJS.  I'm gonna use AJAX to send the form data to my server and then write some NODJS magic to send it to my email! BOOM!

# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Started Over

### Day 1: July 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I'm publicly committing to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge starting today! I fixed all the bugs regarding email authentication in order to send form data via JavaScript and then emailing the message generated from my website to my email address.


**Thoughts:**: I've skipped a couple of days and will start over again.  I don't code on Sundays and will only count from Mondays to Saturdays. So, for all practical purposes in this challenge I only have a six day week. I've already made progress by coding more consistently that in the past. Fixing email authentication as well as the API call from my website makes me feel marvelous!

### Day 3: July 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed JavaScript functions. Function scope, block scope, lexical scope, function expressions, higher order functions, returning functions, the keyword "this", adding methods to objects.


**Thoughts:**: Hello JavaScript my old friend. The thing about functions is that if it is not functioning as it should, you have a function without any function. Ha ha ha. Feeling positive and great. 

**Link to work:**: Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022

### Day 4: July 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed JavaScript Array Callback Methods. Foreach, map, some and every, arrow functions and "this", filter and reduce.

### Day 6: July 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Make a list of all attainable short term goals. Build a timeline page of my coding journey.  Basic layout of article section done

**Thoughts:**: The timeline project is something to look forward to.  It will compliment the project index. (Perhaps I should consider using them in tandem so I have an indication of what I started and what managed to finish and what is still in limbo) 

**Link to work:**: [My Coding Journey Timeline](https://github.com/SVDwebtech/codingJourneyTimeline036)

### Day 7: July 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Add vertical timeline, and add further styling to timeline article section, timeline circle and vertical timeline.

**Link to work:**: [My Coding Journey Timeline](https://github.com/SVDwebtech/codingJourneyTimeline036)

### Day 9: July 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Add styling to header heading h1, paragraph and button and move width property from timeline-container to page-wrapper to fix responsiveness on page header.

**Thoughts:**: A day of mixed feelings, because the design of the header doesn't look good at all. Will have to redo it. And I haven't even started on MySQL yet.
